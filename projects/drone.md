In this project we created a system for controlling a drone using a joystick. The code was written in Matlab, and by using linear systems design, we were able to control it with different kinds of sensors. While using a gyroscope, it was necessary to construct a Kalman Filter, which made the measurements less disturbed by noise. For this we needed to create an appropriate model of the system.
