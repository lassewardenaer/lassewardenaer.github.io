In this project we created a system for controlling n elevator using elixir. The system could recover from power loss, loss of internet connection and other faults. The project was focused around solving threading problems, and how to deal with concurrency. 

The system was tested on both physical representation of elevators running on different hardware and connected through TCP. It was also tested by using a simulation tool which was run in the terminal.
