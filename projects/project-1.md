summary: My team developed a system for playing mini tennis against yourself.
---

In this project we created an embedded system from scratch, connecting multiple breadboards through the use of CAN communication, implementing different controllers for our racket, securing appropriate voltage levels for different parts of the system and solutions for a graphical user interface with limited memory. As we created hardware solution for out mini-tennnis game, it was also necessary to make suitable drivers. In the end, we were able to play mini-tennis with 8-bit mario music in the backround.
