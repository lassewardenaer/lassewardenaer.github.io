Asking the correct questions is essential in software engineering. Open source makes it possible to find an answer to almost anything. However, there could be occurences where a problem is hard to find on the web. In that case, you can contribute to the open source community, not necessarily by answering a question, but instead asking a smart one. You will now be presented with two examples of questions, one that is smart and one that is not as smart. The first is about how to pass command line arguments to a Node.js program, while the other is about enums in Python. 

### How to do it

The first question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4351521/how-do-i-pass-command-line-arguments-to-a-node-js-program). This is an example of a good question on stack overflow. One can clearly understand what problem the person is trying to solve as the header says: "How do I pass command line arguments to a Node.js program?". The header is informative and general, so that other developers with similar problems can find this post afterwards. From the post one can see that the developer has tried to find the answer himself or herself before asking. This is important for two reasons. First, the person has done research and understands what is being asked about, and, second, that it is respectfull to keep the forum free of "easy, googleble" questions. In the post the code is simple to access, and the most important code is being showed. In my early days of stack overflow posting, I posted a screenshot instead of the necessary code, which resulted in a one week ban. In other words, do not do like me, do like it has been done in the "How do I pass command line arguments to a Node.js program?"-post. Also, the developer was describing the problem carefully and clearly. Due to the problem being as general as it was, the developer got many answers which, as a result, leads to being able to choose the solution that fits the best for the spesific problem.  

### How not to do it
An example of a question I would regrad as bad can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36932/how-can-i-represent-an-enum-in-python). The title "How can I represent an 'Enum' in Python?" is not a passable. However, if you search for the same thing in google, the first link will take you to [the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html). This is actually Eric Raymonds first rule for using stack overflow, as he says: "Search, then ask on Stack Exchange". In addition, the developer is not describing the problem carefully and clearly. The first thing written is "I'm mainly a C# developer, but I'm currently working on a project in Python.". This is not relevant to the question, and to make the post more consise, this sentence could have been removed entirely. The answers provided to this post was efficient, but at the same time they were not nessecary. 

It is not always wrong to ask questions about something that is easily available in the documentation. Sometimes you want to know why something is as it is. That could spark more interesting answers in the forum.
