UI frameworks can sometimes seem cumbersome to learn. There are many different options out there, and it can be difficult to choose which one to go for, because every tool has both benefits and limitations. However, in general there are a few main advantages of using something like Semantic UI.

### How to build a house
If you build a house, you would usually buy processed materials in the form of planks, nails and so on. On one hand, you will not be able to cut down the tree yourself and shape it exactly as you want with your own personal flavours everywhere. On the other hand, you will be able to build faster, and in most cases, more reliable and standardised constructions. The same is relavant for software development. Do we really need all the posebilities for most projects, or is it sufficient to have a few great tools to allow the development of professional looking websites fast?

### Abstraction
Another important point is readability of the code and standarsization in larger projects. The most popular UI frameworks used today have their origins from larger companies that saw the need for having a tool that abstracts away most of the low level UI development. As a result of the open source community, these tools are now mostly available to the public. Of course, you can choose to build the UI from css and html, or why not use Assambly if you want to be sassy? The point is that most projects have limitations on time and resources, and, often, you do not need to develop something that is perfet, but rather good enough. Using AI you can actually create a decent looking website in 30 seconds. In addition, most UI framworks let you override their solutions, so that it is possible to make it fairly specific to the project's needs.
