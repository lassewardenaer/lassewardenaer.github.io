Before I sat down to learn JavaScrit, I had a few thoughts on what to expect. From what I have heard it could be "dangouros", but is it so? 

First of all, I am probably one of the few that learned Typescript first, and, as a consequence, I also knew a little Javascript. As a result, I was concerned about how safe it could be to evaluate all the logic during run time. On one hand, I could see that smaller project do not need the type safety of TypeScript. On the other hand, I know through Python that run-time errors can be really hard to find, and every tool to combat these bugs are much appriciated. 

My second thought going through the course, was how much the language is devoloping. In only a few years, it has got many new features, which, as a consequence, is an indicator that this will continue to be the case going forward. As a developer, that is good to know. If you want to spend 10 000 ++ hours mastering a new skill, it is reassuring to know that the knowledge is future proof. 

My last thought revolves around the functional aspect of the language. After using Elixir for a couple of projects, I really miss some of the functionality it provides, when using other languages that are more limited in that regard. Many of these features could be found in the ES6 course. However, I do think more freedom surrounding the async functionality could be usefull, but it could also be that I need more training mastering this skill. (You should check out Elixirs threading functionalities though, they are pretty cool)

Anyway, I am ready to head into this new chapter with an open mind. There are allways some positive and some negative aspects of using one tool instead of another. Therefore, my goal is to get an introduction to new tools for solving problems, and most of all learn when these tools are appropriate to use.
