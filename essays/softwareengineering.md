In a world with increasingly more complicated solutions to larger problems, it can be hard to see where one fits in when it comes to problem solving. There could still be room for a new "Steve Wozniaks", people who invent life changing products nearly by themselves by writing a new kernel with pen and paper. However, to truly be part of todays innovations, one must likely be able to cooperate and innovate with a team. 

### Make the Project Move Forward
One concept that can truly be used in all sorts of problem solving is agile project management. The ability to break down a problem into smaller parts is crucial, whether you are building a house, coding or other projects. This is important for multiple reasons. It is much more motivating to work on something, ig you are able to see the road towards the end product. In addition, it ensures that all team members feel involved, by having claiming "ownership" on parts of the project. It is also easier to divide the work based on experience and knowledge. If you are creating a movie, the music would most likely not be produced by the lead actor.

In a complicated world of technology, to truly master a field, one would often need more than a decade. Therefore, finding methods to cooperate is important, not only in web development. 

### Be Precise in What You Do, Always
To communicate well is arguably one of the most important skills to practice, both in your personal and professional life. Code quality teaches this skill by forcing you to think about readability. It is important to be concise, but at the same time easy to understand for others. In addition, you will learn to be precise and remove much of the overhead if done correctly. However, it is not just code quality that needs to be this way. If you are attending a meeting, one would often need to explain concepts to people without the same skill set. Consequently, it is vital to be able to adapt the language and your way of getting your point across to others. For instance, the employees in the marketing department might not have a degree in technology, but they can learn the essential concepts that are important to sell.     

### Do the Correct Choices Now
What is then the result of joining large large projects and choosing a
