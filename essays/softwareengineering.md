In a world with increasingly more complicated solutions to larger problems, it can be hard to see where one fits in when it comes to problem solving. There could still be room for a new "Steve Wozniaks", people who invent life changing products nearly by themselves by writing a new kernel with pen and paper. However, to truly be part of todays innovations, one must likely be able to cooperate and innovate with a team. 

### Make the Project Move Forward
One concept that can truly be used in all sorts of problem solving is agile project management. The ability to break down a problem into smaller parts is crucial, whether you are building a house, coding or other projects. This is important for multiple reasons. It is much more motivating to work on something, ig you are able to see the road towards the end product. In addition, it ensures that all team members feel involved, by having claiming "ownership" on parts of the project. It is also easier to divide the work based on experience and knowledge. If you are creating a movie, the music would most likely not be produced by the lead actor. Similarly, while coding on a larger project, the expert on network programming would most likely not do the design of the UI. In a complicated world of technology, to truly master a field, one would often need more than a decade. Therefore, finding methods to cooperate is important, not only in web development. 

### Do the Right Choices Now
