It can be hard to see the meaning of all the small things you learn everyday. However, if you look back a year or two it can be easier to see the bigger steps. Radgrad can work as an inverse to this sort of thinking, where clear goals make the small things you learn everyday both meaningfull and interesting. If you take a picture and divide it into a hundred pieces, it is usually not as fascinating. The same is relevant for learning. Even if some topics are less interesting, you see through this tool that they can be necessary to end up where you want to be.   

### The Branches of Computer Science
As I looked through the different subjects in Radgrad, it struck me how diverse computer science really is. Everything from robotics to game design have a lot of similarities. This is essential for being able to check out the different branches of computer sciencem without having to fully commit to one single branch early on. All subjects can help you in some way, regardless of which field you end up in. For instance, if you learn about computer vision, it can be used in self driving cars, or to develop a game on a VR headset. 

### Discoveries
From before I knew that I wanted to look more into subjects related to data science, such as machine learning and big data. However, I also found a few subjects that would be fun to try out. An example is game design, where I could apply some of my creative characteristics and combine them with what I have learned from the three years of my MSc in control engineering.

### Helping my degree
On one hand, I am an exchange student, so I will probably not use this tool after my year in Honolulu is over. On the other hand, Radgrad showed me some interesting opportunities and subjects that I will remember going forward. It would have been a usefull tool to have back at my home university, especially during the first couple of years studying.
