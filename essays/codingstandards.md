What makes a codebase useful and powerful? A lot of people think of coding standards in a trivial way, by for instance focusing on indents and where to put curly-braces. However, coding standards in a project can actually be vital for its success. 

### Larger Projects
When solving a problem it is nessecary to write readable code, both for others and yourself when you eventually have to go back to it again. I would argue that by using coding standards you will be able to solve problems faster and smarter. This especially true if you are working together with a larger team. If everyone writes the code in the same style, it is far easier to understand eachothers code. These projects can involve hundreds of thousends of lines of code. It is not hard to why you would want to understand one style, instead of understanding many personal ones. The interesting part is not how you wrote the for-loop, or that you did an impressive one liner, but, instead, what problems the code solves, and how you would be able to use that code elsewhere.   

### "The Correct Way To Do It?
We can often read at forums such as StackOverflow, that a problem can be solved in some way. If there exists coding standards for a "good" way to write a specific language, most people would try to use this style. Then it would also be easier to ask for help, and answer questions, due to the fact that both sides are "on the same wave length". Just as it was important in a larger project, it is also important when trying to learn a language.

### Do you want strict parents?
If you were asked today if you would have candy for breakfast every morning as a child, you would most likely say no. I look at ESLint as a strict parent, where some actions are forbidden, while others could pass if I ask it for an exception. This is extremly helpfull, especially to force learning new habits, or to ensure that, as mentioned earlier, a project has a consistent style. Even though some rules can seem tedious, it will often result in a you being gratefull for the extra effort.
