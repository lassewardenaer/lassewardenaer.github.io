Software engineering has endless possebilities. Practically everyone uses digital tools. Ever since I got my first GameBoy as a five year old kid, I wondered how it worked, and after some years of hobby projects, I got into my dream field of study: Cybernetics and Robotics.

Today, I have mostly done projects related to mathematical models and low level programming. In many ways, I think this is a nice way starting out the learning of software engineering. By having a fundemental understanding of both hardware and low level software, one can understand why it is important to find effective solutions. In addition, if you have coded on less powerfull hardware, you can also bring this to other fields, for instance preservation of memory. 

In general, I think control engineering can be applied to most things in life, also software engineering in general. Control theory is about finding the measurements that best suit the problem you are trying to solve, and then use those measurements in a feedback system. Examples of this can be controlling a drone, a self driving car or securing the correct pressure levels in a gas container. However, it can also be applied to life and work methods. If you do test based programming, this is a sort of feedback system, or if you are learning something and test your knowledge in some way. My professor in Norway, Trond Andresen, even thought the goverment in many ways should be based on this system. It is safe to say that he was not the biggest fan of capitalism. 

Now my interest has shifted more towards data science and how to solve practical problems with large amouts of data. My dream job would probably be to work for the UN, analyzing important problems. With development is both software methods and hardware power, more advanced problems can be solved. Maybe we can one day use AI, big data, optimization and other tools to solve problems like cancer, hunger, lack of electricity, climate change and many other major subjects.
